# Test your Memory! memory game

Click [here](https://owencookman.github.io/MilestoneProject2/) to view the deployed website.

The objective of this webpage is to provide users of all ages a way to exercise and improve their memory as well as a way to fight boredom, the aim is to create a memory based game that provides some challenge with varying degrees of difficulty selected by the user. 

## UX

The website is aimed at people who have difficulty with memory or would like to exercise their memory skills, this could be adults to older people who struggle to remember things, children who can both exercise their memory while being entertained or general users who are looking for a quick source of entertainment.

### User Stories

#### User with memory difficulties
As someone who has difficulty remembering things, I would like to find a game that is entertaining, not too much of a challenge to begin with and will help to improve my memory.

#### User exercising memory skills
As a younger developing person I would benefit from exercising my memory, I woud like to find a way that will keep me entertained and allow me to control the difficulty that I am playing at.

#### User looking for quick entertainemnt 
As someone who has some spare time on my hands I would like to find a game that doesn't require too much investment and can provide a quick source of entertainment.

#### Wireframes
