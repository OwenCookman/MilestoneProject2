The objective of this webpage is to provide users of all ages a way to exercise and improve their memory as well as a way to fight boredom, the aim is to create a memory based game that provides some challenge with varying degrees of difficulty selected by the user. 

## UX

The website is aimed at people who have difficulty with memory or would like to exercise their memory skills, this could be adults to older people who struggle to remember things, children who can both exercise their memory while being entertained or general users who are looking for a quick source of entertainment.
